# Presentations

This is a simple app that allows you to explore the various ways a view can be presentated. Most of the configuration is done purely in the storyboard and very little code is needed. 

The purpose is to demonstrate how the presentation options work. Try this on iPad and iPhone to see the difference in behavior.

Note: When a controller is presented using CurrentContext or OverCurrentContext, that the context must be set on one of the parent view controllers. Otherwise, the root view controller becomes the current context.
